Repository implementing Learnable Gradient Descent method for image restoration via recurrent neural networks (RNNs)

This work is related to final project on 2020 Bayesian Methods of Machine Learning course at Skoltech. Initially I am trying to reproduce a restoration method, proposed in paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04008.pdf, whcih is now commonly known as a learnable gradient descent restoration. More detailed description is given [here](https://github.com/ys-koshelev/lgd/blob/master/description.pdf).
